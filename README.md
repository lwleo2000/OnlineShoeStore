</p>

<p>Besides, based on the user’s gender recorded in the database, the website style switches between a Womanish and Manish styles.</p>

<p>The main dashboard has a set of input elements for the user to filter the database data and see what they need. The shoes data (including picture) will be shown in a grid form within the main dashboard (just like Lazada’s view). When a user clicks on a shoe’s picture within the grid, its complete details of that shoes pair will be shown. Those details will appear in a new webpage that contains the following information / description of selection tabs:
  
- Details of shoe

- Return policy and delivery information
